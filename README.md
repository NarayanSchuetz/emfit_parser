# EMFIT-QS Parser

Currently provides tools to parse raw data files from EMFIT-QS sensors.
Please note, that we are in no way associated with the company Emfit Ltd. and this is simply for our own use and if
someone finds it useful.

Allows to parse `'.csv'` as well as `'.edf' files. Provides implementation for old '.csv' as well as new '.csv' files.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> We found `'.edf'` files to have some timestamp problems, please make sure to manually check it as this might get
      fixed by the manufacturer sooner or later. Our current quickfix seems to work with the data we currently have.
